# Setup for Project
for downloading dependencies of client or server. I will take the example of client

``` 
cd assignment 
cd client 
yarn 
```


#### now setup .env file in both client and server.
#### frontend runs on port 3000 and backend runs on port 8000

#### for REDIS i have used upstash redis so API key would have to be added for the backend to work by logging into Upstash and adding the link provided by upstash in REDIS_KEY variable.
### alternatively you can Install redis on your device or use redis via docker.
