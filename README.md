# Setup for Project
for downloading dependencies of client or server. I will take the example of client

``` 
cd assignment 
cd client 
yarn 
```


#### now setup .env file in both client. I have added .env file only the value of the environment variable needs to be added.

#### frontend runs on port 3000 and backend runs on port 8000

#### for REDIS i have used upstash redis so API key would have to be added for the backend to work by logging into Upstash and adding the link provided by upstash in REDIS_KEY variable.


## Assumptions
#### I have assumed that when the bomb gets defused it is removed from the deck.
